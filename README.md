# This is a Physics Buddy Chat Bot.
# This ChatBot is used to solve all the questions related to modern day physics that may include equations,formulae and other stuffs
# Here,in this project I have used openAI and cloned a search engine called "text-davinci-003" which will analyze my input prompt word by word and will provide all the relevant information under 50 words to me
# Also, I have deployed this application using Streamlit, wherein the students can just ask their query and press the "ask" button and then the physics buddy chatbot will give explaination regarding the query.
